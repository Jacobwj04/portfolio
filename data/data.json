As the user scrolls down, they can find information about what BMV actually is, inspired by Amsterdam 750. Next, there is the Organization section, which consists of 3 cards. When the user clicks on one of these cards, they get to see an animation that expands the cards. I did this to hide a lot of text and not distract the user. The next section is the Projects section, which consists of 8 cards. The cards display the current project title and a button to go to the project page. Lastly, there is the Work at BMV section, providing more information about BMV and where you can apply to work or submit job applications.\n\n"

The contact page displays the location of BMV and BMV's contact information, allowing the user to get in touch directly. When the user is on the contact page, they will notice that the navigation is dynamically adjusted. Additionally, the footer is also dynamically modified. Lastly, I created a project page that only appears when the user clicks on one of the projects. On the project page, the user sees an automated slider and a description of the project."

Als de gebruiker nabeneden scrolt kan hij informatie vinden van wat BMV eigelijk is. Dit sectie heeft de inspiratie van Amsterdam 750. Daarna kan je de Organistatie sectie zien die bestaat uit 3 kaartjes. Zodra de gebruiker op een van deze kaartjes druk krijgt hij een animatie te zien die de kaartjes uitklapt.Dit heb ik gedaan zodat je veel text kan versptoppen en wordt de gebruiker niet afgelijd. De volgende deel is de projecten sectie die bestaat uit 8 kaartjes. In de kaartjes staat de huidige titlel van het project maar ook een knop om naar de project pagina te gaan. Als laaste is de werkenbij sectie die meer informatie geeft over BMV en waar je kan opgeven om daar te werken of solicteren.\n\n"
